# Benchmark Output: Smolen Case Study

## Overview

This folder provides a **reference benchmark output** generated by **HySimODE** from the *Smolen synaptic tagging and capture model* (`smolen_odes.py`).  
It includes three independent hybrid stochastic–deterministic simulation runs using the trained Random Forest Classifier (RFC).

The structure and contents of this folder reproduce what HySimODE automatically generates under `output_hybrid/` after execution.

---

## Reproduction Command

To reproduce these results locally, run:

```bash
python hysimode.py --model smolen_odes.py --tfinal 500 --dt 0.5 --runs 3
```

This will generate a new folder named `output_hybrid/` with the same internal organization as this benchmark.

---

## Folder Contents

- **`runs/`**  
  Contains individual hybrid simulation results (`results_run1.csv`, `results_run2.csv`, `results_run3.csv`), where each file holds the full time–series data for all species.

- **`summary/`**  
  - `species_summary.csv` — Mean and standard deviation computed across runs.  
  - `plots/` — Mean ± SD trajectories for all species (reduced resolution images).

- **`timeseries_txt/`**  
  Plain-text export of the last simulation run, with one `.txt` file per species and a common `time.txt` vector.

- **`rfc_decisions.csv`**  
  Species classification results from the trained RFC model (`0 = deterministic`, `1 = stochastic`).

---

## Notes

- This benchmark corresponds to **three simulation runs** of the Smolen model, each performed with identical initial conditions and parameters.  
- All results were obtained with HySimODE’s hybrid integrator using BDF ODE solving for deterministic species and SSA updates for stochastic species.  
- The data are intended for **reproducibility verification** and as a **reference layout** for reviewers and new users.
