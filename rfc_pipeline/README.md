# 🧠 RFC Training and Testing Pipeline for HySimODE

This directory contains all scripts, data structures, and procedures used to train, calibrate, and testing the **Random Forest Classifier (RFC)** employed in **HySimODE** to assign biochemical species to *deterministic* or *stochastic* simulation regimes.

## Contents
- `train_rfc.py` – Training and calibration of the classifier.
- `make_features_rfc.py` – Feature extraction from training models.
- `rfc_metadata.json` – Stored metadata (best parameters, threshold, metrics, features).
- `rfc_calibrated.joblib` – Calibrated classifier used in all subsequent analyses.

---

## 🧠 Purpose & Reproducibility

This pipeline ensures **full reproducibility** of the machine learning component described in the HySimODE manuscript.  
The trained RFC learns from quantitative features extracted from multiple ODE-based biochemical models and generalizes to unseen systems.

- **Goal:** Automate species regime classification (deterministic vs. stochastic) using abundance-derived features.
- **Approach:** Random Forest Classifier (RFC) trained on nine mechanistic ODE models.
- **Validation:** Independent testing on two unseen systems — the *host–repressilator* model and the *Smolen* synaptic tagging model.
- **Reproducibility:** All scripts, configurations, and intermediate outputs are versioned and open.

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install the following dependencies before running any script:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn joblib matplotlib
```

Additional built-in modules used:
`os`, `json`, `typing`, `importlib.util`

## 🧩 Training the RFC (with 9 ODE models)

All training scripts are contained in the folder:

```
rfc_pipeline/rfc_training/
```

### Structure

```
rfc_training/
├── models_training/                # 9 ODE models used for supervised training
│   ├── model1.py
│   ├── ...
│   └── model9.py
│
├── make_features_training.py       # Simulates ODE models and extracts statistical features
├── train_rfc.py                    # Trains and calibrates the RFC (produces .joblib & .json)
├── rfc_calibrated.joblib           # Final trained classifier
├── rfc_metadata.json               # Feature metadata (names, calibration, parameters)
└── feature_definitions.md          # Description of extracted features
```

### Training Workflow

1. **Generate features**
   ```bash
   python generate_features_training.py
   ```
   This script simulates the 40 training ODE mechanistic systems and outputs a combined CSV (`features_rfc.csv`) with quantitative descriptors and labels. Details of the model dataset are in the Supplementary Information of the HysimODE manuscript.

2. **Train the Random Forest**
   ```bash
   python train_rfc.py
   ```
   This script trains a Random Forest classifier to predict whether biochemical species should be simulated stochastically (1) or deterministically (0) using features derived from deterministic simulations.

   The pipeline includes:

   Hyperparameter optimization using RandomizedSearchCV
   Class-balanced training
   Probability calibration (isotonic regression)
   Decision threshold optimization for the stochastic class

   Two evaluation modes are supported:

   Standard mode – stratified train/validation split with cross-validation.
   LOMO (Leave-One-Model-Out) – evaluates generalization to unseen biochemical models.

   Optional robustness analyses in LOMO mode include:

   Nested LOMO hyperparameter search
   Bootstrap confidence intervals over held-out models
   Permutation tests (within-model or global label permutation)
   The script outputs the trained model and evaluation summaries:

   rfc_calibrated.joblib – calibrated classifier
   rfc_metadata.json – model configuration and metrics
   lomo_metrics_by_model.csv – per-model evaluation results
   lomo_summary.json – aggregated LOMO statistics

## 🧪 Testing on Unseen Models (host_repressilator, smolen)

Independent generalization testing is located in:

```
rfc_pipeline/rfc_testing_unseen_models/
```

### Structure

```
rfc_testing_unseen_models/
├── host_repressilator/
│   ├── make_features_host_repressilator.py     # Generates feature CSV for the repressilator model
│   └── predict_with_rfc_on_host_repressilator.py  # Applies the trained RFC → rfc_decisions.csv
│
├── smolen/
│   ├── make_features_smolen.py
│   └── predict_with_rfc_on_smolen.py
│
├── results/                                   # Stores all prediction CSVs
└── README.md                                  # Local usage instructions
```

### Example Workflow

#### Host–Repressilator
```bash
python make_features_host_repressilator.py
python predict_with_rfc_on_host_repressilator.py
```

Generates:
- `features_host_repressilator.csv`
- `predictions_host_repressilator.csv` → contains predicted class labels and probabilities

#### Smolen Model
```bash
python make_features_smolen.py
python predict_with_rfc_on_smolen.py
```

Generates:
- `features_smolen.csv`
- `predictions_smolen.csv`
